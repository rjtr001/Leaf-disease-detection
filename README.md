# Leaf-disease-detection
This work proposed a CLHAE and Total variation filter-based VMD (variational mode decomposition) method for image decomposition. Deep learning models DenseNet121 and VGG-19 are used for feature extraction from sub-band images, and extracted features are concatenated and fed to Random Forest for classification. Utilizing tenfold cross-validation, our model demonstrated enhanced classification accuracy (98.85%), specificity (99.37%), and sensitivity (98.0%) in detecting Disease from Mango leaf images. Feature maps and Grad-CAM analysis were conducted to visualize and scrutinize the essential regions crucial for accurate predictions. Statistical analysis indicates that our proposed architecture outperforms pre-trained models and existing mango leaf disease detection methods. This diagnostic approach can be a rapid disease detection tool for imaging specialists utilizing leaf images.
